#Ludum Dare 24 Entry: Devolution
The contest's theme is evolution.

##Story
It is the year 2050. Mankind has finally achieved an elusive goal: interplanetary travel. Our hero was selected over thousands of similarly skilled volunteers for this one-way journey to Mars. After a year of spaceflight, he prepares to touch down on the alien planet, only to learn that a critical landing thuster has not survived the journey. 

Our hero survives a crash landing on the Martian surface, but the ship doesn't. The ship's nuclear core is leaking onto the Martian soil, endangering Martians. The creatures who have been exposed to the spilling nuclear core are mutating! Mutated Martians are now becoming violent. Our hero must contain the spill to save himself, the mission, and Mars!
